# Software Engineer Test

## Requirement

You have to design a solution to handle the process of a purchase on an ecommerce. You have to defined the software architecture and explain the reasons why you would select it. Develop one of the software components of your design.

## What We Care About

Use any libraries that you would normally use if this were a real production App. Please note: we're interested in your code & the way you solve the problem, not how well you can use a particular library or feature.

We're interested in your method and how you approach the problem just as much as we're interested in the end result.

Here's what you should strive for:

- Software architecture diagram
- Good use of the backend stack selected - Use Springboot (Java or Kotlin), NodeJs (Express, Loopback or Hapi framework).
- Software design best practices.
- Solid testing approach.
- Extensible code.

## Bonus

- Providing an online demo is welcomed, but not required.

## Good luck!

We look forward to seeing what you can do. Remember, although it is a test, there are no specific right or wrong answers that we are looking for - just do the job as best you can.
